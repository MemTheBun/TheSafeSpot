# Included mods

Here you can find the mod comparison table between the currently supported Minecraft versions (may not be accurate for alphas and betas). Some mods have been obsoleted or superseded by better alternatives in the newer versions - [see the changelog for full info](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). You can also find the version-specific mod list by clicking on the version on CurseForge or Modrinth.

The selected mods are inspired, but not limited by the [list of OptiFine alternatives](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives). The modpack also [improves the default settings](https://fabulously-optimized.gitbook.io/modpack/readme/changed-options).
